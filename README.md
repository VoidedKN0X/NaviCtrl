## Planned

Not in the app yet: genre pages.

## Screenshots

Coming soon.

## Requirements

- Android 13 or newer, on a 64-bit ARM phone (nearly every phone from the last several years)
- A Navidrome server
- **Google-free and de-Googled:** no Google Play services, Firebase or other Google services, and the app never contacts Google. It works the same on de-Googled phones (GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, /e/OS, LineageOS without Google apps).

## Install

1. Download the latest `.apk` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/VoidedKN0X/NaviCtrl/releases/latest).
2. Open it on your phone. Android may ask you to allow installing apps from your browser or file manager.
3. Updates install over the old version. Your settings and login are kept.

**Automatic updates:** on your phone, tap one of the buttons below.

- **Obtainium:** install [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) first. The button adds NaviCtrl and installs every new release for you.
- **F-Droid:** adds the [CtrlF-Droid repo](https://voidedkn0x.github.io/CtrlF-Droid/) to F-Droid, Droid-ify or Neo Store, with every Ctrl app and automatic updates.

If the Obtainium button doesn't open the app, add `https://github.com/VoidedKN0X/NaviCtrl` in Obtainium by hand.

## Getting started

1. Enter your Navidrome address, e.g. `https://music.example.com`.
2. Sign in with your Navidrome username and password.
3. Tap **Shuffle all**, pick a song, or open the **Playlists** tab to start listening.

Downloads, **Settings**, accounts, sign out and (for admins) **Scan for new music** are behind your profile picture at the top right.

## Tips and troubleshooting

- **Plain HTTP** works, but the app warns you first because your password would be sent unencrypted.
- **Start a mix from this song** (in a song's menu) needs Last.fm set up in Navidrome.
- **Scrobbling** and play counts use **Settings > Report what I play**; Last.fm and ListenBrainz are linked in Navidrome itself.

## Privacy

**Telemetry-free.** NaviCtrl has no analytics, crash reporting, usage stats or tracking of any kind. It only talks to your own Navidrome server: cover art, lyrics and similar songs all come through it, and scrobbles to Last.fm and ListenBrainz are sent by Navidrome, not by the app.

## Build from source

You need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), or JDK 17 and the Android SDK.

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VoidedKN0X/NaviCtrl.git
   cd NaviCtrl
   ```
2. Build the app:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   On Windows, use `gradlew.bat assembleDebug`.
3. The APK is in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. Copy it to your phone and install it.

Or open the folder in Android Studio and press **Run** with your phone connected.
